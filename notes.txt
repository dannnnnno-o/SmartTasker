||| Smart Tasker |||

DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM:
SmartTasker is a console-based to-do list manager built in C language that helps students and professionals organize their tasks efficiently. Unlike a regular to-do list, SmartTasker automatically assigns priority levels to tasks based on their deadlines and difficulty level. This ensures that the most urgent and challenging tasks are highlighted first, helping users manage their time more effectively.

FEATURES:
    Task Management – Add, edit, delete, and view tasks.
    Automatic Priority Setting – System calculates priority by combining deadline proximity and task difficulty.
    Task Sorting – Tasks are displayed in order of priority.
    Search Function – Find tasks by keyword or category.
    Statistics Summary – Shows number of tasks pending, completed, and overdue.
    Simple Workspace – Menu-driven interface for easy navigation.

LIMITATIONS:
    Tasks must be entered and deleted manually.
    Deadline tracking is limited to simple date input (no real-time clock).
    Console-based interface (no GUI or online access).
    Data is not auto-synced; saving and loading must be done through text files.
